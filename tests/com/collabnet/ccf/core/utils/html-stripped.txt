               Subversion 1.5 Beta1 Released
             
           
           
             
                The Subversion project has issued the beta1release on the path to Subversion 1.5. CollabNet  created binaries for Linux, Windows  and Solaris and we updated the CollabNet Merge Client (compatible binaries of Subclipse and TortoiseSVN are available as well). Read Mark Phippard's blog post about beta1   and start testing SVN 1.5, the more people test and provide feedback, the better  SVN 1.5 will be.

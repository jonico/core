/**
 * The connection manager is responsible to manage the connection pools
 * for each source/target system.
 * It creates and manages one pool per repository.
 * As the connection manager does not know the type of the connection object
 * for each and every system that exists in the world, it depends on the 
 * ConnectionFactory class to retrive a connection for a particular system.
 * The plugin providers should implement the ConnectionFactory 
 * (com.collabnet.ccf.core.eis.connection.ConnectionFactory) by properly parameterizing the
 * connection object's class into the implemented class.
 * In the wiring configuration file they need to set the ConnectionFactory bean
 * in the ConnectionManager's connectionFactory property.
 * 
 *  A sample wiring file
 * snippet that configures a ConnectionManager to manage SFEE connections is shown below.
 * <code>
 * <bean id="SFEEConnectionManager"
 * 		class="com.collabnet.ccf.core.eis.connection.ConnectionManager">
 * 		<description>
 * 			The connection manager implements a connection pooling mechanism where the 
 * 			connections to multiple systems are cached for the readers and writers
 * 			to retrieve when needed. Before returning the connection to the client
 * 			the connection manager checks if the connection is live and only returns 
 * 			valid connections.
 * 			It assigns and manages one pool per repository.

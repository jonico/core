			<xs:documentation>This is the root element for every entity that is transportetd through the CCF pipeline. If the artifact's mode is not "attachment", the element will typically only contain field-sub-elements. If it is an attachment, it may also contain a BASE64 encoded text-string, describing the content of the attachment. The content of an attachment does not have to be shipped if the artifactMode is set to "changedFieldsOnly".</xs:documentation>

				<xs:element name="field" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded">
					<xs:annotation>
						<xs:documentation>A field has a name and a field type and contains a typed value for the property of the artifact that is described by this field. If a field with the same name and field type occurs more than once, this indicates a multi-value property within the artifact. The content of the field element varies from value type to value type, but it is always encoded as a string, so structured values are currently not allowed.</xs:documentation>

							<xs:annotation>
								<xs:documentation>This attribute contains the type of the field. This is not the type of the field's value but a mechanism to differentiate different artifact properties with the same name.

						<xs:attribute name="fieldAction" type="xs:string" use="required">
							<xs:annotation>
								<xs:documentation>This attribute determines whether the content of the value tag should be "append"ed, "replace"d, or "delete"d. Valid values are "append", "replace" and "delete". Note that most systems will only support the "replace"-action and that source systems usually do not know anything about the  characteristics of the target system.</xs:documentation>

				<xs:annotation>
					<xs:documentation>The value of this attribute could be either “complete” or “changedFieldsOnly” – which denote how the source system has formed this artifact. Typically, source systems are expected to provide a complete artifact, but in some cases, this may not be possible or might be very imperformant (e. g. updated meta-data for attachments), and when that happens, the source system should set this mode value to “changedFieldsOnly".</xs:documentation>

				<xs:annotation>
					<xs:documentation>This attribute defines if this artifact should be "create"d, "update"d, "delete"d or  "ignore"d by the target system. As long the artifact has not yet passed the entity service (that may change the value), the value will typically be "create" or "delete", since the source system does not know whether the artifact has been already created in the target system.  The four possible values of action are "create", "update", "delete", and "ignore".</xs:documentation>

This <i>freeway</i> is not for transporting cars but for <i>transporting ALM related</i> data. For every new tool that likes to use the freeway, you <i>just</i> have to <i>provide a ramp</i> and <i>your tool data</i> can <i>travel anywhere (</i>into any other tool connected with a ramp to the freeway).&quot;</p><p align="center" class="line862"><font size="4">&quot;So what's so nice about the CCF?&quot;</font></p><p class="line862">In terms of our freeway metaphor it is &quot;<i>not building the freeway twice</i>&quot; or even a little bit more general &quot;not inventing the wheel over and over again&quot;. If you think back how integrations between tools are usually done, you probably agree that most of them are actually point-to-point integrations. If you build a point-to-point integration between tool A and tool B, you typically have to deal with three steps:</p><ol><li>Define, design, build and test the components used to extract and write data into tool A (a <i>ramp</i> in our freeway methaphor)</li><li>Define, design, build and test the components used to extract and write data into tool B (a <i>ramp</i> in our freeway methaphor)</li><li>Define design, build and test the components used to synchronize the data between the tools, care about identity mapping,  data mapping, transactionality, error recovery, logging, locking, usability,  configuration, user interaction, security, load balancing, conflict resolution, transport protocols, meta data changes, documentation, throttling, streaming, installation, packaging, testing, monitoring, ... (an ordinary <i>street </i>in our freeway metaphor)</li></ol><p>According to our experience, it is a valid approach to conclude from the length of the bullet points to the amount of time spent for each of these steps.</p><p>One point-to-point integration is usually not the only integration within a bigger company. In a complex application lifecycle scenario, the data of one tool has to be transported to numerous other tools, so there is the need for many tool integrations. If we now also like to connect tool A with tool C we would have to repeat step one to step three again if we used the point-to-point integration approach again. Especially step 2 and step 3 seem to be duplicated work but unfortunately this is often the case of point-to-point integrations built by different contractors or development teams.<br /> </p><p>By using the CCF for our integration, we only have to build another ramp for tool C and we are done. Every functionality described in step 3 is core functionality of the CCF and can be considered as our &quot;data freeway&quot;. This functionality (mapping, logging, routing, ...) can be used by every &quot;car&quot; travelling over our our freeway no matter from which &quot;ramp&quot; it comes from and which &quot;ramp&quot; it likes to use to exit the freeway.</p><p>If you read the last sentence, you probably noticed that by providing a ramp for tool C, we now also have the possibility to synchronize tool B and tool C with each other without writing any further code. Just think about the possibilities you get if you do not just have three but twenty ramps!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="line862"> </p><p class="line862">The CCF SDK contains components used to extract artifacts from SourceForge Enterprise Editions (SFEE) and CollabNet Enterprise Editions (CEE) repositories and transform them to a canonical XML based format. <span id="line-14" class="anchor" /><span id="line-15" class="anchor" /></p><p class="line862">The CCF SDK also contains components that can understand artifact data represented in the Generic Artifact XML format and write them back into SFEE and CEE repositories.<span id="line-16" class="anchor" /><span id="line-17" class="anchor" /></p><p class="line862">The CCF SDK contains components that solely work on the generic artifact XML representation and provide system independent support functions to facilitate the synchronization process (e. g. identity mapping, artifact data transformation and CSV file to generic artifact convertors).

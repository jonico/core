These component are called Readers. <span class="anchor" id="line-14" /><span class="anchor" id="line-15" /></p><p class="line862">The CCF SDK contains components that can understand artifact data represented in the Generic Artifact XML format and write them back into SFEE and CEE repositories. These components are called Writers. <span class="anchor" id="line-16" /><span class="anchor" id="line-17" /></p><p class="line862">The CCF SDK contains components that solely work on the generic artifact XML representation and provide system independent support functions to facilitate the synchronization process (e. g. identity mapping, artifact data transformation and CSV file to generic artifact convertors). These components are called Processors. <span class="anchor" id="line-18" /><span class="anchor" id="line-19" /></p><p class="line862">All components can be used totally independent from each other and only communicate by the standard mechanisms of openAdaptor (i. e. by modifying the artifact data traveling through the openAdaptor message pipeline). They can be used without adaption with any other standard openAdaptor component as as with any third party component following the generic artifact XML format specification for its input and output. <span class="anchor" id="line-20" /><span class="anchor" id="line-21" /></p><p class="line862">The CCF SDK contains documentation and examples how to wire the independent components together in order to achieve a certain integration scenario (e. g.

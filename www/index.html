This <i>freeway</i> is not for transporting cars but for <i>transporting ALM related</i> data. For every new tool that likes to use the freeway, you <i>just</i> have to <i>provide a ramp</i> and <i>your tool data</i> can <i>travel anywhere (</i>into any other tool connected with a ramp to the freeway).&quot;</p><p align="center" class="line862"><font size="4">&quot;So what's so nice about the CCF?&quot;</font></p><p class="line862">In terms of our freeway metaphor it is &quot;<i>not building the freeway twice</i>&quot; or even a little bit more general &quot;not inventing the wheel over and over again&quot;. If you think back how integrations between tools are usually done, you probably agree that most of them are actually point-to-point integrations. If you build a point-to-point integration between tool A and tool B, you typically have to deal with three steps:</p><ol><li>Define, design, build and test the components used to extract and write data into tool A (a <i>ramp</i> in our freeway methaphor)</li><li>Define, design, build and test the components used to extract and write data into tool B (a <i>ramp</i> in our freeway methaphor)</li><li>Define design, build and test the components used to synchronize the data between the tools, care about identity mapping,  data mapping, transactionality, error recovery, logging, locking, usability,  configuration, user interaction, security, load balancing, conflict resolution, transport protocols, meta data changes, documentation, throttling, streaming, installation, packaging, testing, monitoring, ... (an ordinary <i>street </i>in our freeway metaphor)</li></ol><p>According to our experience, it is a valid approach to conclude from the length of the bullet points to the amount of time spent for each of these steps.</p><p>One point-to-point integration is usually not the only integration within a bigger company. In a complex application lifecycle scenario, the data of one tool has to be transported to numerous other tools, so there is the need for many tool integrations. If we now also like to connect tool A with tool C we would have to repeat step one to step three again if we used the point-to-point integration approach again. Especially step 2 and step 3 seem to be duplicated work but unfortunately this is often the case of point-to-point integrations built by different contractors or development teams.<br /> </p><p>By using the CCF for our integration, we only have to build another ramp for tool C and we are done. Every functionality described in step 3 is core functionality of the CCF and can be considered as our &quot;data freeway&quot;. This functionality (mapping, logging, routing, ...) can be used by every &quot;car&quot; travelling over our our freeway no matter from which &quot;ramp&quot; it comes from and which &quot;ramp&quot; it likes to use to exit the freeway.</p><p>If you read the last sentence, you probably noticed that by providing a ramp for tool C, we now also have the possibility to synchronize tool B and tool C with each other without writing any further code. Just think about the possibilities you get if you do not just have three but twenty ramps!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align="center"><font size="4"><i>&quot;So how does it work?&quot;</i></font> <br /></p><p>So if by just providing a ramp for a new tool, the data from this tool can be synchronized with any other tool, does this mean that the data format always have to look the same? When you think about a real freeway, not all cars look exactly the same and they can still use the same ramps. However, there are certain restrictions for every car when it comes to its dimensions, license plates, speed, etc.</p><p>Similar constraints apply to the artifacts (data packets) travelling the CCF freeway. They all have to follow a well defined XML format. This format does not constrain the number, values and characteristics of the tool data but it defines the way, this data is represented. Using this representation, every ramp is able to receive artifact data from any other ramp. The representation is also important to correctly &quot;route&quot; the artifact data to the correct exit ramp (think about traffic signs showing directions on the freeway). The representation format is called &quot;Generic Artifact (XML) Format&quot;.<br /></p><p>If you like to use the CCF, there is a high chance that there is already a ramp for the tools you like to synchronize. The core CCF provides ramps for SourceForge Enterprise Edition, CollabNet Enterprise Edition, flat delimited text files and data base tables, or to express it in a more formal way (cited from our requirements Wiki):</p><p class="line862"> </p><p class="line862">&quot;The CCF SDK contains components used to extract artifacts from SourceForge Enterprise Editions (SFEE) and CollabNet Enterprise Editions (CEE) repositories and transform them to a canonical XML based format. <span class="anchor" id="line-14" /><span class="anchor" id="line-15" /> [...] The CCF SDK also contains components that can understand artifact data represented in the Generic Artifact XML format and write them back into SFEE and CEE repositories.&quot;</p><p class="line862">If your favourite tool is still not supported, all you have to do is to write a new ramp that understands the &quot;Generic Artifact (XML) Format.&quot; Since the CCF is based on a very powerful &quot;ramp construction kit&quot; called openadaptor, building new ramps should be really straight forward.</p><p class="line862">Once your &quot;cars&quot; (artifact data) are on the freeway you just have to specify the transformations to be applied on them and where they should exit the freeway again. The freeway itself consists of multiple core CCF components that were constructed following the best practices of numerous point-to-point integrations done at CollabNet and other companies. You do not have to use all core components of the CCF for your particular integration scenario, but just the ones you need. Fr instance, as long as you just mirror data, you do not have to use any data transformation component. Consider the CCF as a toolbox of ramps and freeway building blocks you can combine however you want without having to write a single line of code, or to express it in a more formal way (cited from our requirements Wiki):<br /></p><p class="line862">&quot;The CCF SDK contains components that solely work on the generic artifact XML representation and provide system independent support functions to facilitate the synchronization process (e. g. identity mapping, artifact data transformation and CSV file to generic artifact convertors).  <span class="anchor" id="line-18" />[...]<span class="anchor" id="line-19" /> All components can be used totally independent from each other and only communicate by the standard mechanisms of openAdaptor (i. e. by modifying the artifact data traveling through the openAdaptor message pipeline). They can be used without adaption with any other standard openAdaptor component as as with any third party component following the generic artifact XML format specification for its input and output. &quot;</p><p class="line862">The process of wiring the different components together (think about putting the correct traffic signs on the freeway) is not complicated at all. We already provide lots of standard integration scenarios within the CCF download. You may just change some property values to see CCF in action within your own system landscape, so to cite from our Wiki again:<br /></p><p class="line862">&quot;The CCF SDK contains documentation and examples how to wire the independent components together in order to achieve a certain integration scenario (e. g. SFEE to SFEE tracker synchronization or CSV file to CEE tracker synchronization).&quot;</p><p class="line862">&nbsp;</p><p class="line862">&nbsp;</p>

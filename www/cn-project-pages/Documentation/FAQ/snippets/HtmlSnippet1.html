<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /><p>Q: I have configured my wiring but after I started it the connector just idles around, what's wrong?</p><p>A: Two reasons are possible. First of all it might be that there are currently no updates available in your source system. The other reason is that within the ccf.properties file, the sql statement used to retrieve the synchronization status rows this scenario should work on does not match any of the rows in this table. Look at the WHERE clause whether it matches your entry in the synchronization status table.<br /></p><p>We need your questions, so please take part in our <a href="http://ccf.open.collab.net/servlets/ProjectProcess?pageID=R8t1Km">community</a>  and ask as may questions as you like.</p><p>We can also point you to a nice <a href="https://www.openadaptor.org/release-docs/3_4_2/FAQ.html">FAQ</a>  related to openadaptor.

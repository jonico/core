<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />                              <p><b>Q:</b> I have configured my wiring but after I started it the connector just idles around, what's wrong?</p><p><b>A:</b> Two reasons are possible if your source system is not a HP QC system. First of all it might be that there are currently no updates available in your source system. The other reason is that within the ccf.properties file, the sql statement used to retrieve the synchronization status rows this scenario should work on does not match any of the rows in this table. Look at the WHERE clause whether it matches your entry in the synchronization status table.</p><p>If it is a HP QC system, a third reason is possible. Every field that should be synchronized has to be configured that its changes are logged in the history.<br /></p><p><b>Q:</b> I got an unsatisfied link error while trying to use the HP QC plugin: &quot;java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: This application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.&quot; What should I do?</p><p><b>A:</b> Please <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=200b2fd9-ae1a-4a14-%20984d-389c36f85647&amp;displaylang=en">download</a>  the Visual Studio 2005 libraries and install them. </p><p><b>Q: </b>Do I always have to create a mapping for the technical ids of release field values in order to synchronize release fields?</p><p><b>A: </b>Unfortunately, some APIs of CCF's supported system can only update release fields of tracker items if you know the technical release of your id. However, the reader and writer components of these systems typically provide a boolean property called <span class="longstring">&quot;translateTechnicalReleaseId&quot; that allows you to use the human readable name of the release instead of the technical id. This property is set to false in our default wirings since the lookup involves additional web service calls that might decrease the update performance. If you can live with these additional web service</span> calls, you may edit the wiring of your integration scenario and set the <span class="longstring">&quot;translateTechnicalReleaseIds&quot; property to true.</span></p><p><b>Q: </b>I initially imported lots of artifacts and now they all belong to the connector user. Should not they belong to the initial creator?</p><p><b>A:</b> The CCF uses the connector user (and sometimes the resynch user) to do all the synchronization work. Since CCF uses the web services of the target systems and these web services usually do not support to perform operations on behalf of another user, all artifacts will be created with the connector user as creator. The same applies to update operations as well.</p><p><b>Q</b>: I initially imported lots of artifacts and now their creation date is the import date. Should not it be the original creation date?</p><p><b>A: </b>The web services, CCF uses to synchronize artifacts, usually do not support to set another creation date but the actual time when the artifact was imported into the target system.</p><p><b>Q: </b>When I create or update artifacts with the connector user/resynch user account, these updates will not show up immediately in the other system/attachments will not be synchronized. Why is that?</p><p><b>A: </b>Please do not use the connector user/resynch user for manual updates. These accounts are reserved for the CCF that needs these users to differentiate whether the update has been made by itself or by a &quot;real&quot; user. <br /></p><p>We need your questions, so please take part in our <a href="http://ccf.open.collab.net/servlets/ProjectProcess?pageID=R8t1Km">community</a>  and ask as may questions as you like.</p><p>We can also point you to a nice <a href="https://www.openadaptor.org/release-docs/3_4_2/FAQ.html">FAQ</a>  related to openadaptor.

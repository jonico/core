First of all it might be that there are currently no updates available in your source system. The other reason is that within the ccf.properties file, the sql statement used to retrieve the synchronization status rows this scenario should work on does not match any of the rows in this table. Look at the WHERE clause whether it matches your entry in the synchronization status table.</p><p>If it is a HP QC system, a third reason is possible. Every field that should be synchronized has to be configured that its changes are logged in the history.<br /></p><p>Q: I got an unsatisfied link error while trying to use the HP QC plugin: &quot;java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: This application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.&quot; What should I do?</p><p>A: Please <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=200b2fd9-ae1a-4a14-%20984d-389c36f85647&amp;displaylang=en">download</a>  the Visual Studio 2005 libraries and install them. <br /></p><p>We need your questions, so please take part in our <a href="http://ccf.open.collab.net/servlets/ProjectProcess?pageID=R8t1Km">community</a>  and ask as may questions as you like.</p><p>We can also point you to a nice <a href="https://www.openadaptor.org/release-docs/3_4_2/FAQ.html">FAQ</a>  related to openadaptor.

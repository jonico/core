The CCF SDK is an openAdaptor based SDK that allows rapid integrations and migrations dealing with the artifact data shared between different tools in the ALM cycle in combination with the collaborative platforms from CollabNet.</div><div align="justify"> </div><div align="justify">This page will point you to the information you need in order to learn more about the CCF. You can read these documents step by step or just jump directly to the documents you are mostly interested in.</div><div align="justify"> </div><div align="center">&nbsp;</div><div align="center"><font size="4">General Information about the CCF</font></div><div align="center"> </div><div align="justify">Most of the requirements and descriptions, what the CCF should be can be found in our <a title="Wiki" href="http://ccf.open.collab.net/wiki/">Wiki</a>. The detailed goals and the purpose of the  CCF can be found <a title="there" href="http://ccf.open.collab.net/wiki/The_Purpose_of_the_Project">there</a> as well as its <a href="http://ccf.open.collab.net/wiki/The_Client%2C_the_Customer%2C_and_Other_Stakeholders">anticipated customers, stakeholders and clients</a>.</div><div align="justify"> </div><div align="justify">If you are interested in using the CCF but not yet sure whether it was designed for your specific profile, please look in the <a href="http://ccf.open.collab.net/wiki/Users_of_the_Product">user categories</a> of the CCF to find out.</div><div align="justify"> </div><div align="center">&nbsp;</div><div align="center"><font size="4">The environment, CCF is typically used in</font></div><div align="center"> </div><div align="justify">If you read the general information about the CCF you might still be wondering whether the environment your integration will take place in is supported by the CCF. The <a title="Wiki" href="http://ccf.open.collab.net/wiki/">Wiki</a> again can help to see the <a href="http://ccf.open.collab.net/wiki/Mandated_Constraints">constraints of the environment, CCF was designed for</a>.</div><div align="justify"> </div><div align="center"> </div><div align="center"><font size="4"><br />Underlying technologies of the CCF</font></div><div align="center"> </div><div align="justify"> </div><div align="justify">The CollabNet Connector Framework is heavily based on <a class="https" href="https://www.openadaptor.org/">openAdaptor</a> and the (self explaining) component wiring configuration language of the <a href="http://www.springframework.org/">Spring Framework</a>. As long as you just want to use the CCF for some of the many preconfigured  and prepackaged scenarios which come with the standard distribution of the CCF, you do not have to be familiar with openAdaptor at all.</div><div align="justify"> </div><div align="justify">If you are interested in implementing your own connectors to third party tools or want to use some of the many predefined openAdaptor components (file readers, file writers, access to various middlewares and transaction systems, JMS, JMX, data bases, web services, JNDI, FTP, SMTP, Servlets, XSLT processors, Schema validators, object streamers, message filters based on velocity and java script, ...) within your integrations without having to write a single line of code, you should take a look in the <a href="https://www.openadaptor.org/docs/whitepaper.pdf">white paper</a>  of openAdaptor (eight-pager) and this <a href="http://pdf.sys-con.com/Java/Openadaptor_Spread.pdf">excellent article</a>.</div><div align="justify">&nbsp;</div><div align="justify"> </div><div align="center"> </div><div align="justify"> </div><div align="center">                                             </div><p align="center"><font size="4">Predefined scenarios supported by the CCF</font></p><p align="justify">The fastest way to get started with the CCF is probably by trying the <a href="http://ccf.open.collab.net/wiki/ExampleScenarios">preconfigured example integration scenarios</a>. All you have to do is just to change some configuration properties (like URL of your SFEE site, trackers to be synchronized and user credentials) and watch CCF do its synchronization job. Once you managed to run the examples you can start looking into the example wiring files (fully documented) to find out how the scenario was actually accomplished and try to change some further aspects. We also encourage you to try to combine the features of multiple examples (just copy paste the features you need).<br /> </p><p align="justify">If you want to achieve an integration scenario that goes far beyond the predefined scenarios, it might be the time to read the section above (about the underlying technologies) and learn more about openAdaptor. After this, you will have enough knowledge how to integrate further components into your wiring files to get the exact integration you want. It may also help to read the following section dealing with the specific terms used within the CCF.</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

The CCF SDK is an openAdaptor based SDK that allows rapid integrations and migrations dealing with the artifact data shared between different tools in the ALM cycle in combination with the collaborative platforms from CollabNet.</div><div align="justify">&nbsp;</div><div align="justify">This page will point you to the information you need in order to learn more about the CCF. You can read these documents step by step or just jump directly to the documents you are mostly interested in.</div><div align="justify">&nbsp;</div><div align="center"><font size="4">General Information about the CCF</font></div><div align="center">&nbsp;</div><div align="justify">Most of the requirements and descriptions, what the CCF should be can be found in our <a title="Wiki" href="http://ccf.open.collab.net/wiki/">Wiki</a>. The detailed goals and the purpose of the&nbsp; CCF can be found <a title="there" href="http://ccf.open.collab.net/wiki/The_Purpose_of_the_Project">there</a> as well as its <a href="http://ccf.open.collab.net/wiki/The_Client%2C_the_Customer%2C_and_Other_Stakeholders">anticipated customers, stakeholders and clients</a>.</div><div align="justify">&nbsp;</div><div align="justify">If you are interested in using the CCF but not yet sure whether it was designed for your specific profile, please look in the <a href="http://ccf.open.collab.net/wiki/Users_of_the_Product">user categories</a> of the CCF to find out.</div><div align="justify">&nbsp;</div><div align="center"><font size="4">The environment, CCF is typically used in</font></div><div align="center">&nbsp;</div><div align="justify">If you read the general information about the CCF you might still be wondering whether the environment your integration will take place in is supported by the CCF. The <a title="Wiki" href="http://ccf.open.collab.net/wiki/">Wiki</a> again can help to see the <a href="http://ccf.open.collab.net/wiki/Mandated_Constraints">constraints of the environment, CCF was designed for</a>.</div><div align="justify">&nbsp;</div><div align="center"><font size="4">Underlying technologies of the CCF</font></div><div align="center">&nbsp;</div><div align="justify">The CollabNet Connector Framework is heavily based on <a class="https" href="https://www.openadaptor.org/">openAdaptor</a> and the (self explaining) component wiring configuration language of the <a href="http://www.springframework.org/">Spring Framework</a>. As long as you just want to use the CCF for some of the many preconfigured&nbsp; and prepackaged scenarios which come with the standard distribution of the CCF, you do not have to be familiar with openAdaptor at all.</div><div align="justify">All you have to do in these cases is just to change some configuration properties (like URL of your SFEE site, trackers to be synchronized and user credentials) and watch CCF do its synchronization job.</div><div align="justify">If you are interested in writing your own integrations&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div align="justify">&nbsp;</div><div align="center">                                             </div>

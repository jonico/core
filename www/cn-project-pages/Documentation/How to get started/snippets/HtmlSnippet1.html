The detailed goals and the purpose of the  CCF can be found <a title="there" href="http://ccf.open.collab.net/wiki/The_Purpose_of_the_Project">there</a> as well as its <a href="http://ccf.open.collab.net/wiki/The_Client%2C_the_Customer%2C_and_Other_Stakeholders">anticipated customers, stakeholders and clients</a>.</div><div align="justify"> </div><div align="justify">If you are interested in using the CCF but not yet sure whether it was designed for your specific profile, please look in the <a href="http://ccf.open.collab.net/wiki/Users_of_the_Product">user categories</a> of the CCF to find out.</div><div align="justify"> </div><div align="center"> </div><div align="center"> </div><div align="center">&nbsp;</div><div align="center">&nbsp;</div><div align="center"><font size="4">The environment, CCF is typically used in</font></div><div align="center"> </div><div align="justify">&nbsp;</div><div align="justify">&nbsp;</div><div align="justify">If you read the general information about the CCF you might still be wondering whether the environment your integration will take place in is supported by the CCF. The <a title="Wiki" href="http://ccf.open.collab.net/wiki/">Wiki</a> again can help to see the <a href="http://ccf.open.collab.net/wiki/Mandated_Constraints">constraints of the environment, CCF was designed for</a>.</div><div align="justify"> </div><div align="center"> </div><div align="center"><font size="4"><br />Underlying technologies of the CCF</font></div><div align="center"> </div><div align="justify"> </div><div align="justify">&nbsp;</div><div align="justify">&nbsp;</div><div align="justify">The CollabNet Connector Framework is heavily based on <a class="https" href="https://www.openadaptor.org/">openAdaptor</a> and the (self explaining) component wiring configuration language of the <a href="http://www.springframework.org/">Spring Framework</a>. As long as you just want to use the CCF for some of the many preconfigured  and prepackaged scenarios which come with the standard distribution of the CCF, you do not have to be familiar with openAdaptor at all.</div><div align="justify"> </div><div align="justify">If you are interested in implementing your own connectors to third party tools or want to use some of the many predefined openAdaptor components (file readers, file writers, access to various middlewares and transaction systems, JMS, JMX, data bases, web services, JNDI, FTP, SMTP, Servlets, XSLT processors, Schema validators, object streamers, message filters based on velocity and java script, ...) within your integrations without having to write a single line of code, you should take a look in the <a href="https://www.openadaptor.org/docs/whitepaper.pdf">white paper</a>  of openAdaptor (eight-pager) and this <a href="http://pdf.sys-con.com/Java/Openadaptor_Spread.pdf">excellent article</a>.</div><div align="justify"> </div><div align="justify"> </div><div align="center"> </div><div align="justify"> </div><div align="center">                                             </div><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center"><font size="4">Predefined scenarios supported by the CCF</font></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">The fastest way to get started with the CCF is probably by trying the <a href="http://ccf.open.collab.net/wiki/ExampleScenarios">preconfigured example integration scenarios</a>. All you have to do is just to change some configuration properties (like URL of your SFEE site, trackers to be synchronized and user credentials) and watch CCF do its synchronization job. Once you managed to run the examples you can start looking into the example wiring files (fully documented) to find out how the scenario was actually accomplished and try to change some further aspects. We also encourage you to try to combine the features of multiple examples (just copy paste the features you need).</p><p align="justify">If you want to achieve an integration scenario that goes far beyond the predefined scenarios, it might be the time to read the section above (about the underlying technologies) and learn more about openAdaptor. After this, you will have enough knowledge how to integrate further components into your wiring files to get the exact integration you want. It may also help to read the  section below dealing with the specific terms used within the CCF.</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center"><font size="4">The Generic Artifact XML Format<br /></font></p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">After trying out the basic example you will find out that in order to synchronize your own trackers, you actually have to specify (e. g. by using an XSLT file) how the artifact fields of your source artifact have to be transformed to fit the format of the target artifacts (for explanation of the term artifact, please read the following section). The CCF already abstracts from the vendor specific artifact and repository format so you do not have to concentrate on implementation specific details.</p><p align="justify">All you have to understand (to some point) is one XML based artifact format that is used by all CCF compliant components. This format is called Generic Artifact XML Format and is defined based on an fully documented XML schema you can find <a href="http://ccf.open.collab.net/servlets/ProjectProcess?pageID=aT1rGG&amp;subpageID=nLKvgT">here</a>.</p><p align="justify">Don't panic: A simple integration will only use a minority of the features defined within this specification. The predefined examples already come along with lots of transformation files doing things like value substitutions, field deletion, field renaming and adding of constant values, so you can just use these XSLT files and adjust them to fit your needs. <br /></p><p align="justify">Once you basically understood these transformation files and the generic artifact format (you can also use the predefined Generic Artifact Export scenario to get an idea how the artifacts of your tracker look in the generic artifact xml format), you can start specifying your own artifact transformations the CCF will execute for you.</p><p align="center"> </p><div align="center">&nbsp;</div><div align="center"><font size="4">Technical Terms and Abbreviations used within the CCF</font></div><div align="center"> </div><div align="justify">&nbsp;</div><div align="justify">&nbsp;</div><div align="justify">The CCF <a title="Wiki" href="http://ccf.open.collab.net/wiki/">Wiki</a> also contains the <a href="http://ccf.open.collab.net/wiki/Naming_Conventions_and_Definitions">technical terms and abbreviations</a> that are typically used within the technical discussions about the CCF. These terms are very important to know if you decided to write your own CCF compliant components (what a CCF compliant component is, is also explained there), like to participate in the core development of our framework or just like to understand the concepts of the CCF in depth. Also if you like to understand the ongoing technical discussions on our <a href="http://ccf.open.collab.net/ds/viewForumSummary.do?dsForumId=586">developer mailing list </a> it is probably a good idea to know what polling cycles, identity mapping tables, sychronization info records or entity services actually are.</div><div align="justify"> </div><div align="center">&nbsp;</div><div align="center"><font size="4">Developer documentation for the CCF</font></div><div align="justify">&nbsp;</div><div align="justify">&nbsp;</div><div align="justify">If you read through all the wiring files of the predefined example scenarios and had a look into our glossary of terms, you should be able to understand the source code of the CCF as well. The source code can be found within our <a href="http://ccf.open.collab.net/source/browse/ccf/">SVN repository</a> which can be browsed online as well as the <a href="http://ccf.open.collab.net/nonav/javadocs/index.html">generated javadocs</a>.

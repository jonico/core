CollabNet Connector Framework (HP Quality Center and CollabNet ScrumworksPro Integrations with CollabNet TeamForge)
Version 1.5.1

Introduction:
-------------             

The CollabNet Connector Framework enables synchronization
of backlog items, tasks, releases, sprints, themes, teams and products
between CollabNet TeamForge (5.3+) and ScrumWorks Pro (4.4+).

CollabNet Connector Framework also enables shipment of defect and requirement data 
from HP Quality Center (9.0, 9.2, 10.0, 11.0) to a CollabNet tracker
(Project Tracker or TeamForge tracker), and vice versa.

CollabNet Connector Framework (HP Quality Center and CollabNet ScrumworksPro Integrations with CollabNet TeamForge)
Version 1.5.1 - Mirror from ccf.open.collab.net

Introduction:
-------------             

The CollabNet Connector Framework enables synchronization
of backlog items, tasks, releases, sprints, themes, teams and products
between CollabNet TeamForge (5.3+) and ScrumWorks Pro (4.4+).

CollabNet Connector Framework also enables shipment of defect and requirement data 
from HP Quality Center (9.0, 9.2, 10.0, 11.0) to a CollabNet tracker
(Project Tracker or TeamForge tracker), and vice versa.

For new developers:

	How to setup source code:

		1.For code development we uses Spring Tool Suite(STS) eclipse(version 2.8 or greater).
			Download Link -> https://sagan-production.cfapps.io/tools
		2.Checkout the source code from the repo and import the project as java project.
		3.Follow STS eclipse based menu options to import the project.
			File -> Import -> Java -> File System
		4.Above said works well for compiling and building the project locally in your system.

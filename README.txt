                Collabnet Connector Framework v1.1
                ----------------------------------
                
Introduction:                
Collabnet Connector Framework or CCF is a framework to synchronize data between
various systems. For example v1.0 ships with support for HP Quality Center defects
(v9.0 and v9.2) and Collabnet SourceForge Enterprise Edition trackers(v4.4).

You can of course add support for other systems and artifact types. You can achieve this
by Creating a CCF plugin compliant with the CCF Generic Artifact Schema (Please refer
to the CCF home page for more details)

Getting Started:
This package comes with a few samples between QC and SFEE. Please refer to the README.txt
files in the samples directory, on how to get started and synchronize between these two systems.

How to Contribute:
You could participate in certain design and development processes of the CCF. Please refer to
the CCF homepage (given below) for more details.

Support:
Please refer to the License.html for support and other options.

Happy Connecting!
